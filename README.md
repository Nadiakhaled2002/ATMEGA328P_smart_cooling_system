#Smart cooling system

A system that reads the room temperature using LM35 temperature sensor then turn on the DC motor when the temperature exceeds 30 â„ƒ then displays the temperature on an LCD and there is an automatic turn off option. The DC motor speed is affected by the temperature so if the temperature is high the speed will increase and if its low the speed will decrease.
